## Auth Demo

- **Authentication**: are you who you say you are? (i.e., you need the right password.)
- **Authorization**: okay, so you are who you say you are... but what exactly are you allowed to do now? (I.e., web tokens and/or sessions)

### Set Up:
- Run:
    - `npm run db:create`
    - `npm run db:reset`
    - `npm install`
    - in `/client`, run `npm install`
- start server with `npm run dev`
- serve react: in `/client` run `npm start`
